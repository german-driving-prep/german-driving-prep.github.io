# Right of Way: The Priority Pyramid

This is the hierarchy of rules at any German intersection. The rule at the top always beats the ones below it. `$Rechts vor Links$` is the last resort.

---

### ðŸ¥‡ 1. Police Officer (`Polizeibeamter`)
- Their hand signals override ALL other rules. What they say, goes.

---

### ðŸ¥ˆ 2. Traffic Lights (`Ampeln`)
- A working traffic light overrides all signs.
- **Green Light:** You have priority to proceed in the direction shown.
- **Flashing Yellow Light:** The light is not in service. Look down to Level 3 (Signs).

---

### ðŸ¥‰ 3. Traffic Signs (`Verkehrszeichen`)
- If there are no lights or police, signs dictate priority.
- **You HAVE Priority:** When you see the yellow diamond sign (`VorfahrtsstraÃŸe`).
- **You MUST YIELD Priority:** When you see the Yield sign or a STOP sign.

---

### 4. Special Situations ("Entering" Traffic)
- The vehicle "entering" the road must yield to everyone. This rule beats `$Rechts vor Links$`.
- This applies when exiting from:
  - A lowered curb (`abgesenkter Bordstein`)
  - A private property or driveway
  - A parking lot
  - A traffic-calmed area (`verkehrsberuhigter Bereich`)
  - A field or forest path

---

### 5. Default Rule (`Grundregel`)
- If **NONE** of the above apply (no police, lights, signs, or special situations), then and only then does **`$Rechts vor Links$`** (Right before Left) rule the intersection.
