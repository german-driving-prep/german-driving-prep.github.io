# Critical Exam Maneuvers Checklist

---

### Emergency Brake (`Gefahrbremsung`)
1.  **Action:** Examiner shouts "STOP!" -> **Clutch and Brake HARD** at the same time.
2.  **Recovery:**
    - **SECURE:** Turn on **hazard lights** (`Warnblinker`).
    - **WAIT:** Breathe. Wait for the examiner's instruction to continue.
    - **PREPARE:** Restart if stalled. First gear. Turn hazard lights OFF.
    - **OBSERVE:** **Full 360° check:** Mirrors AND shoulder checks (both sides).
    - **GO:** Move off smoothly.
- **Key Mistake to Avoid:** Panicking and driving off without the full observation.

### Autobahn
- **Merging (Auffahrt):**
  - Use the **full length** of the acceleration lane.
  - Accelerate **forcefully** to match traffic speed (`~100 km/h`).
  - **Mirror -> Signal -> Shoulder Check (`Schulterblick`)** before merging.
- **Exiting (Abfahrt):**
  - Signal right at the **300m marker**.
  - Perform a right shoulder check before entering the exit lane.
  - **Brake ONLY when you are fully IN the exit lane.**
- **Key Mistake to Avoid:** Braking on the main Autobahn lanes.

### Parallel Parking (`Längsparken`)
- **Setup:** Start ~1 meter beside the car in front.
- **Reference Points:** Use the points your instructor taught you (e.g., seeing the back of the car in the rear passenger window, seeing the headlights of the car behind in your side mirror).
- **Positioning:** Finish close to the curb (~20cm) and centered in the space.
- **Observation:** Remember to look around *during* the slow maneuver.
- **Key Mistake to Avoid:** Hitting the curb hard or finishing too far away from it.
