# Rules for Pedestrians, Cyclists & Buses

Protecting those outside your car is a top priority.

---

### Pedestrians (`Fußgänger`)
- **Zebra Crossing (`Zebrastreifen`):** You **must stop** if a pedestrian wants to cross or is waiting to cross. Approach with caution.
- **Turning:** When you turn right or left, any pedestrian wanting to cross the street you are entering has priority. You must wait.

---

### Cyclists (`Radfahrer`)
- **The "Right Hook":** The most dangerous situation. When turning right, you **MUST** perform a shoulder check (`Schulterblick`) to ensure no cyclist is continuing straight alongside you. They have priority.
- **Passing:** You must maintain a minimum distance of **1.5 meters** when overtaking a cyclist.

### Public Buses (`Linienbusse`)
- **Case 1: Bus has HAZARD LIGHTS ON at a stop.**
  - **Rule:** **DO NOT PASS.** You must wait behind the bus.
- **Case 2: Bus at a stop uses its LEFT TURN SIGNAL.**
  - **Rule:** **YOU MUST YIELD.** Slow down or stop to let the bus pull out.
