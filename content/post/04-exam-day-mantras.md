# Exam Day Mantras & Final Reminders

Repeat these to yourself to stay calm and focused.

---

- ### `Blicken. Denken. Lenken.`
  - (Look. Think. Steer.) The core process of driving.

- ### `Spiegel, Blinker, Schulterblick. Immer.`
  - (Mirror, Signal, Shoulder Check. Always.) Your non-negotiable safety sequence.

- ### `Kein Schild? Rechts vor Links.`
  - (No Sign? Right before Left.) Your default thought at an unsigned intersection.

- ### `Bordstein runter, Vorfahrt runter.`
  - (Curb down, priority down.) The simple rule for lowered curbs and driveways.

- ### `Bus blinkt links? Ich bremse.`
  - (Bus signals left? I brake.) The immediate reaction for letting a bus out.

You have done the training. The examiner is not looking for a perfect driver, they are looking for a **safe** one.

**Trust your preparation. You are ready.**
