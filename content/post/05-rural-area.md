# Driving on the Überlandstraße (Rural Road)

The `Überlandstraße` is any road outside of a town's limits. It's where the examiner tests your ability to handle higher speeds and anticipate different types of hazards. The default speed limit is **100 km/h** for cars, but signs often reduce this.

### What the Examiner is Looking For

* **Confident Speed Control:**
    * You are expected to drive confidently at higher speeds (e.g., 90-100 km/h) where it is safe and legal. Driving too slowly shows a lack of confidence.
    * You must also demonstrate the ability to reduce your speed appropriately and smoothly for sharp curves, hills, or poor weather conditions.

* **Anticipatory Driving (`Vorausschauendes Fahren`):**
    * Look far ahead down the road, not just at the area directly in front of your car.
    * Anticipate the path of a curve before you enter it.
    * Be constantly aware of potential, hidden dangers.

* **Correct Lane Positioning:**
    * Stay firmly in the center of your lane, especially in curves.
    * Never cut corners, as you could collide with oncoming traffic you can't yet see.

* **Safe Overtaking (`Sicheres Überholen`):**
    * This is a high-risk maneuver. Only even consider it if you have a very long, clear view of the road ahead and there is no solid line.
    * The examiner will be more impressed by you correctly deciding **not** to perform an unsafe overtake than by you rushing to pass a slow vehicle.

### Common Hazards Checklist

Be alert for:
-   Sharp curves that may not be signposted.
-   Hills and dips that hide oncoming traffic.
-   Slow-moving vehicles like tractors.
-   Hidden entrances from fields or forests (`Feldweg`).
-   The possibility of wildlife crossing (`Wildwechsel`).

**Key Mantra:** Look far, hold your lane, and adapt your speed.
