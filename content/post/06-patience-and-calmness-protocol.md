This is the most important file. Read it last. This is a test of safety, **not a race**. Rushing leads to mistakes. Patience demonstrates control.

### If You Are Behind a Cyclist...
- **Your Action:** You wait. Maintain a safe distance. You only overtake when you can guarantee the minimum **1.5-meter** side distance and the road ahead is completely clear.
- **The Reality:** Waiting behind a cyclist for 30 seconds is **correct driving**. A rushed, unsafe overtake is a **fail**.

---

### If You Need to Yield for a Clear Space (e.g., at a Yield sign)...
- **Your Action:** You wait. You wait until a gap appears that is large enough for you to enter **safely and without forcing** the other cars to brake.
- **The Reality:** Taking an extra 10 seconds to correctly judge a safe gap is **good driving**. Pulling out into a small gap and causing another car to slow down is an **endangerment** and a **fail**.

### If You Are Waiting to Turn Left and Causing a Traffic Jam...
- **Your Action:** You wait. Oncoming traffic has **absolute priority**. Your only job is to wait in your position until there is a safe gap for you to turn.
- **The Reality:** Waiting for one minute while cars pile up behind you is **100% correct driving**. The traffic behind you is legally required to wait for you. Turning in front of oncoming traffic is the **most dangerous mistake** you can make and an **instant, absolute fail**.

## Your Final Mantra

**The cars behind me do not matter. The clock does not matter. Only the space in front of me and the rules matter.**

You are not being judged on your speed. You are being judged on your safety. By being patient, you are demonstrating that you are a safe driver. You are correct. Be calm.
