# Einbahnstrasse Rules

This file covers the two types of one-way streets (`Einbahnstraße`) and the different rules for positioning your car. The key is to always check for the small additional sign.

---

### Scenario 1: Standard One-Way Street

**The Sign:** A square blue sign with a single, large white arrow.

**The Rule:** Traffic flows in one direction only for all vehicles.

**Key Action: Turning Left**
- **Your Position:** You **must** move your car to the **far left edge** of the road before making the turn.
- **Why:** This allows traffic behind you that is going straight or turning right to pass you on the right.

**Common Mistake:** Staying in the middle or on the right to turn left. This is incorrect positioning and blocks traffic unnecessarily.

### Scenario 2: One-Way Street WITH Cyclist Exception

**The Sign:** The standard blue `Einbahnstraße` sign **PLUS** a small white sign underneath showing a bicycle symbol (`Radfahrer frei`).

**The Rule:** The street is one-way for cars, but **TWO-WAY for cyclists.**

**Key Action: Change Your Mindset**
- **Your Position:** You **must** treat this like a narrow, two-way street. **Stay on the right side of the road at all times.**
- **Be Alert:** Constantly expect cyclists to appear from the opposite direction.
- **Turning Left:** Position your car near the center of the road (not the far left) and yield to any oncoming cyclists before you turn.

**Common Mistake:** Missing the small white sign and and driving on the left side of the road, creating a dangerous head-on situation with a cyclist. This is a critical safety failure.

### Final Takeaway

**Always check for the small white sign under the blue arrow.** It completely changes how you must position your car.
