# Checklist: Driving in a Zone 30

This checklist covers the key rules, awareness points, and maneuvers required for safely navigating a `Zone 30` during your practical exam.

### General Rules & Awareness

- **Recognize the Zone:** `Zone 30` is for traffic calming in residential areas to protect pedestrians and children.
- **Adhere to the Speed Limit:** The **maximum speed is 30 km/h**. Be prepared to drive slower if conditions require it.
- **Identify Entry & Exit:** The zone begins with the `Zone 30` entry sign and only ends when you pass the specific **"Zone 30 End" sign**.
- **The Limit Persists:** The 30 km/h limit **does not end** when you turn onto another street within the zone. It must be explicitly lifted by an "end" sign.
- **Anticipate Mistakes:** Always assume you are the only one following the rules and be prepared for others' errors.

### Right-of-Way & Intersections

- **The Default Rule:** In most `Zone 30` areas, the **`Right before Left`** (`Rechts vor Links`) rule applies at any unsigned intersection.
- **Brake Readiness (`Bremsbereitschaft`):** When approaching any unsigned corner, keep your foot **over the brake pedal**, ready to stop instantly.
- **Check Every Corner:** Scrutinize every intersection and entrance for signs to ensure you don't miss a priority rule.
- **Lowered Curbs (`abgesenkter Bordstein`):** Vehicles entering from a street with a lowered curb **must yield to you**. You have priority, but remain cautious.
- **Do Not Give Up Priority:** Show the examiner you know the rules. **Do not stop unnecessarily** to let others pass if you have the right-of-way.
- **Entering with Priority:** If you enter a `Zone 30` on a priority road (`Vorfahrtstraße`), you maintain priority and do not need to be in constant brake readiness, but you must still be observant.

### Maneuvers & Obstacles

- **Drive with Foresight (`vorausschauend fahren`):** Constantly scan the road ahead, check all mirrors, and be aware of your surroundings.
- **Watch for Parked Vehicles:** Maintain a safe side distance and look into parked cars for signs of someone exiting.
- **Signaling to Swerve:** If you must swerve around an obstacle (like a parked car) into the opposing lane, **do not use your turn signal**, as this is only for turns.
- **Turning Around (`umkehren`):** Only turn around in safe, suitable locations. **Do not use private property** (`Privatgrundstück`) to do so.
- **"Anlieger frei" (Residents Free) signs:** Be aware that even if you cannot enter a street, residents can still exit from it. Expect traffic.

### Safety & Exam Tips

- **Prioritize Safety:** Always give extra space to pedestrians, cyclists, and children.
- **`Right-before-Left` is Heavily Tested:** This is one of the main skills the examiner will assess in a `Zone 30`.
- **Basic Maneuvers are Common:** `Zone 30` areas are often used for exam tasks like parking, reversing, and emergency braking due to lower traffic.
- **Show Competence, Not Hesitation:** Be cautious, but act decisively. Show the examiner that you understand and can apply the rules correctly.
