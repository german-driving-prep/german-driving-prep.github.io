This is a summary of the ten most critical mistakes, that will cause you to fail the practical driving exam (`praktische Fahrprüfung`).

---

### 1. 🚦 Ignoring Right-of-Way
> A fundamental error. Forgetting the default **"Right before Left"** (`Rechts vor Links`) rule at an unsigned intersection is a critical mistake.

### 2. 🚶‍♀️ Forgetting Pedestrians When Turning
> When you turn into a new street, any pedestrian crossing that street has priority. You **must** see them and yield.

### 3. 🔴 Running a Red Light
> This is absolute. A red light means stop, well before the stop line. There are no exceptions.

### 4. ✋ Ignoring a Mandatory Halt
> This isn't just a stop sign. If a police officer, a temporary sign, or a specific situation requires a stop, you **must** come to a complete halt.

### 5. ↩️ Cutting the Corner on a Left Turn
> When turning left, you must position your car correctly and avoid swinging into the lane of oncoming traffic (`Gegenverkehr`). A clean turn is essential.

### 6. 👀 Changing Lanes Without Looking
> The complete observation sequence – **Mirrors, Signal, and Shoulder Check (`Schulterblick`)** – is mandatory before *every* lane change.

### 7. 🚌 Speeding Past a Bus with Hazard Lights
> If a bus has its hazard lights on at a bus stop, you are only allowed to pass at **walking speed (`Schrittgeschwindigkeit`)**. Anything faster is a fail.

### 8. 🛑 The "Rolling Stop"
> A STOP sign means your wheels must **completely stop moving**. Rolling through, even very slowly, is not a stop and will be marked as a failure.

### 9. ⛔ Ignoring a "No Entry" Sign
> The `Verbot der Einfahrt` sign (red circle, white bar) is an absolute command. Driving past it is a major violation.

### 10. ➡️ Disobeying a Mandatory Direction Sign
> The round blue signs with white arrows (`Gebotszeichen`) are orders, not suggestions. You must follow the direction shown.

**Final Tip:** Stay focused, drive safely, and avoid these errors to pass your test. `Viel Erfolg!`
