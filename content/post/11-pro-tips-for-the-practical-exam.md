## Core Rules & Right-of-Way

### 🛑 Stop Sign Precision
- You must come to a **complete, motionless stop**.
- Prioritize stopping at the **`Haltelinie`** (stop line).
- If no stop line is present, stop at the **`Sichtlinie`** (sight line), an imaginary line where you can best see cross-traffic.
- **Pro Tip:** To be absolutely sure you've stopped, count **"21, 22"** in your head before proceeding.

### ➡️ Master "Right before Left" (`Rechts vor Links`)
- Expect to find these intersections in residential and **`30 km/h` zones**.
- Approach slowly, ideally in second gear, and be ready to brake.
- If parked vehicles obstruct your view, shift down to first gear to show the examiner you've recognized the potential hazard.

### 🚶‍♀️ Pedestrian Crossings (`Zebrastreifen`)
- Approach with moderate speed and look left and right in advance.
- If a pedestrian wants to cross, you **must stop** before the crossing.
- If traffic is backed up behind the crossing, **always stop before the crossing**, never on it.

### ⛔ Respect "No Entry" Signs
- If you see a sign like **`Anlieger frei`** (Residents/Local Traffic Only), you must recognize that you cannot enter this street during the exam.

## Vehicle Control & Awareness

### 🚗 Passing Parked Vehicles
- Maintain a minimum safety distance of **1 meter** to the side.
- If the street is too narrow to maintain this distance, slow down significantly and observe carefully for opening doors or pedestrians.

### ↔️ Maintain Safe Following Distance
- **Inside urban areas:** Use the **1-second rule** (approx. 15 meters or three car lengths).
- **Outside urban areas:** Use the **speed ÷ 2 rule** (e.g., at 100 km/h, maintain 50 meters distance).

### 🚴 Overtaking Cyclists & Scooters
- Maintain a minimum safety distance of **1.5 meters** inside urban areas.
- Maintain a minimum safety distance of **2 meters** outside urban areas.
- If there's a **continuous white line**, you cannot cross it. It's better to stay safely behind the cyclist.

### 👀 Excellent Traffic Observation
- Every 10 seconds, clearly check your **rearview mirror and both side mirrors**.
- When turning, the sequence is crucial: **Inside Mirror -> Outside Mirror -> Signal (`Blinker`) -> Shoulder Check (`Schulterblick`)**.

## Specific Situations

### ➡️ The One-Way Street (`Einbahnstraße`)
- When turning **left** at the end of the street, you must position yourself on the **far left edge** of the road for the turn.

### 🚧 Obstacles on the Road (`Engstelle`)
- If an obstacle (e.g., a parked car) is on one side of the road, the driver who has the obstacle on their side **must wait** and give priority to oncoming traffic.

### 🚌 Encountering Public Buses
- If a bus uses its **hazard lights** while driving or stopping, you may **never overtake it**. If it's already stopped, you may only pass at **walking speed**.
- If a bus at a stop signals **left** to re-enter traffic, you **must let it in**.

## Final Mindset & Preparation

### 🧘 Be Rested and Calm
- Go to bed early the night before so you are concentrated and focused.
- Don't tell too many people about your test in advance to reduce pressure. Instead, proudly show your license afterward.
- **Ventilate the car** before you start to ensure plenty of oxygen.
