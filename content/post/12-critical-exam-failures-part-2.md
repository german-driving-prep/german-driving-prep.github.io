This file covers more specific and nuanced errors that can lead to failing the practical driving exam (`praktische Fahrprüfung`), building on the previous list.

## 🛣️ Autobahn & High-Speed Roads

- **❌ Overtaking on the Right**
  - This is **absolutely forbidden** on the Autobahn and will lead to an instant fail. Always overtake on the left.

- **➡️ Ignoring the "Keep Right" Rule (`Rechtsfahrgebot`)**
  - If the right lane is free for a reasonable distance, you **must** move back into it. Lingering in the middle or left lane is a fault.

- **💨 Excessive Speed**
  - Exceeding posted limits is a clear failure. Even on sections with an advisory speed (`Richtgeschwindigkeit` of 130 km/h), driving in a way the examiner deems unsafe will be a problem.

- **📏 Unsafe Following Distance**
  - You must be able to stop safely. Remember the rule: keep a distance of at least **half your speedometer value in meters** (e.g., at 100 km/h, keep 50 meters distance).

## 🚗 Vehicle Control & Positioning

- **😵 Repeated Stalling**
  - Stalling once is not a fail, but doing it multiple times in a row demonstrates a lack of fundamental vehicle control.

- **🗺️ Incorrect Lane Positioning (`Einordnen`)**
  - Not positioning your car correctly for a turn is a fault. For a left turn in a one-way street, you must be on the **far left**.

- **📐 Insufficient Side Distance**
  - Not keeping enough space from parked cars is dangerous.
  - When overtaking cyclists, you **must** maintain a minimum of **1.5 meters** in the city and **2 meters** outside the city.

## 📜 Rule Violations & Observation

- **⛔ Crossing a Solid White Line**
  - A solid line (`durchgezogene Linie`) is like a wall. You cannot cross it, not even to pass a slow garbage truck. You must wait.

- **👀 Poor Traffic Observation**
  - Not constantly using your mirrors and performing shoulder checks (`Schulterblick`), especially during maneuvers, shows you are not aware of your surroundings.

- **🚦 Violating Right-of-Way**
  - Failing to yield to oncoming traffic when turning left is a classic, serious error.

## 🚫 "Forbidden Zone" Errors

- **💥 Driving onto the Curb/Sidewalk**
  - Driving your vehicle onto the sidewalk (`Gehweg`), either when parking or trying to avoid traffic, is an instant fail.

- **🏠 Entering "Residents Only" Streets**
  - You cannot enter a street marked **`Anlieger frei`**. This shows you are not reading the signs correctly.

## ✅ Good to Know: These Mistakes Are Usually OK!

- **🧭 Getting Lost or Taking a Wrong Turn**
  - This is **not a mistake!** The examiner is testing your driving skill, not your navigation. If you miss a turn, they will simply give you new directions.

- **🤔 Answering a Technical Question Incorrectly**
  - While it creates a bad first impression, getting a pre-drive safety question wrong does **not** directly fail your practical test.
