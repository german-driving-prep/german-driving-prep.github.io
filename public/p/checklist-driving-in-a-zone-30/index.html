Adhere to the Speed Limit: The maximum speed is 30 km/h. Be prepared to drive slower if conditions require it. Identify Entry &amp; Exit: The zone begins with the Zone 30 entry sign and only ends when you pass the specific &ldquo;Zone 30 End&rdquo; sign. The Limit Persists: The 30 km/h limit does not end when you turn onto another street within the zone. It must be explicitly lifted by an &ldquo;end&rdquo; sign. Anticipate Mistakes: Always assume you are the only one following the rules and be prepared for others&rsquo; errors. Right-of-Way &amp; Intersections The Default Rule: In most Zone 30 areas, the Right before Left (`Rechts vor Links`) rule applies at any unsigned intersection. Brake Readiness (`Bremsbereitschaft`): When approaching any unsigned corner, keep your foot over the brake pedal, ready to stop instantly. Check Every Corner: Scrutinize every intersection and entrance for signs to ensure you don&rsquo;t miss a priority rule. Lowered Curbs (`abgesenkter Bordstein`): Vehicles entering from a street with a lowered curb must yield to you. You have priority, but remain cautious. Do Not Give Up Priority: Show the examiner you know the rules. Do not stop unnecessarily to let others pass if you have the right-of-way. Entering with Priority: If you enter a Zone 30 on a priority road (`Vorfahrtstraße`), you maintain priority and do not need to be in constant brake readiness, but you must still be observant. Maneuvers &amp; Obstacles Drive with Foresight (`vorausschauend fahren`): Constantly scan the road ahead, check all mirrors, and be aware of your surroundings. Watch for Parked Vehicles: Maintain a safe side distance and look into parked cars for signs of someone exiting. Signaling to Swerve: If you must swerve around an obstacle (like a parked car) into the opposing lane, do not use your turn signal, as this is only for turns. Turning Around (`umkehren`): Only turn around in safe, suitable locations. Do not use private property (`Privatgrundstück`) to do so. &ldquo;Anlieger frei&rdquo; (Residents Free) signs: Be aware that even if you cannot enter a street, residents can still exit from it. Expect traffic. Safety &amp; Exam Tips Prioritize Safety: Always give extra space to pedestrians, cyclists, and children. Right-before-Left is Heavily Tested: This is one of the main skills the examiner will assess in a Zone 30. Basic Maneuvers are Common: Zone 30 areas are often used for exam tasks like parking, reversing, and emergency braking due to lower traffic. Show Competence, Not Hesitation: Be cautious, but act decisively. Show the examiner that you understand and can apply the rules correctly. ">
