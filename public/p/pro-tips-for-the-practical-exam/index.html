If a pedestrian wants to cross, you must stop before the crossing. If traffic is backed up behind the crossing, always stop before the crossing, never on it. ⛔ Respect &ldquo;No Entry&rdquo; Signs If you see a sign like Anlieger frei (Residents/Local Traffic Only), you must recognize that you cannot enter this street during the exam. Vehicle Control &amp; Awareness 🚗 Passing Parked Vehicles Maintain a minimum safety distance of 1 meter to the side. If the street is too narrow to maintain this distance, slow down significantly and observe carefully for opening doors or pedestrians. ↔️ Maintain Safe Following Distance Inside urban areas: Use the 1-second rule (approx. 15 meters or three car lengths). Outside urban areas: Use the speed ÷ 2 rule (e.g., at 100 km/h, maintain 50 meters distance). 🚴 Overtaking Cyclists &amp; Scooters Maintain a minimum safety distance of 1.5 meters inside urban areas. Maintain a minimum safety distance of 2 meters outside urban areas. If there&rsquo;s a continuous white line, you cannot cross it. It&rsquo;s better to stay safely behind the cyclist. 👀 Excellent Traffic Observation Every 10 seconds, clearly check your rearview mirror and both side mirrors. When turning, the sequence is crucial: Inside Mirror -&gt; Outside Mirror -&gt; Signal (`Blinker`) -&gt; Shoulder Check (`Schulterblick`). Specific Situations ➡️ The One-Way Street (`Einbahnstraße`) When turning left at the end of the street, you must position yourself on the far left edge of the road for the turn. 🚧 Obstacles on the Road (`Engstelle`) If an obstacle (e.g., a parked car) is on one side of the road, the driver who has the obstacle on their side must wait and give priority to oncoming traffic. 🚌 Encountering Public Buses If a bus uses its hazard lights while driving or stopping, you may never overtake it. If it&rsquo;s already stopped, you may only pass at walking speed. If a bus at a stop signals left to re-enter traffic, you must let it in.
